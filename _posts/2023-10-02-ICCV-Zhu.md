3D human whole-body pose estimation aims to localize precise 3D keypoints on the entire human body, including the face, hands, body, and feet. We introduce Human3.6M 3D WholeBody (H3WB) which provides whole-body annotations for the Human3.6M dataset using the COCO Wholebody layout. H3WB is a large scale dataset with 133 whole-body keypoint annotations on 100K images, made possible by our new multi-view pipeline. Along with H3WB, we propose 3 tasks: i) 3D whole-body pose lifting from 2D complete whole-body pose, ii) 3D whole-body pose lifting from 2D incomplete whole-body pose, iii) 3D whole-body pose estimation from a single RGB image. We also report several baselines from popular methods for these tasks.
