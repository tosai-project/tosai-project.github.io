We propose an algorithm to generate infinite 3D synthetic human poses (Legatus) from a 3D pose distribution based on 10 initial handcrafted 3D poses (Decanus) during the training of a 2D to 3D human pose lifter neural network. Our results show that we can achieve 3D pose estimation performance comparable to methods using real data from specialized datasets but in a zero-shot setup, showing the generalization potential of our framework.
