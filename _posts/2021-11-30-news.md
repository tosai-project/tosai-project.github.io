The first meeting in workshop format took place on November 30th with 8 presentations from the 3 international teams. The goal was to get the different partners up-to-date with respect to the research being done at each lab. The talks covered the whole range of the TOSAI project: birdview reconstruction, material recognition, gaze estimation, pose estimation, uncertainty estimation, image editing, invertible models and 3D head reconstruction. The workshop sparked a lot of interest from all partners and set a excellent start for this project.
