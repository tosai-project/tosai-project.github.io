With this year's ICCV being held in Paris, we took the opportunity to have an in person TOSAI workshop the week before, on September 28th and 29th. The <a href="pdfs/workshop_schedule.pdf">two days' program</a> included <a href="pdfs/workshop_pres.pdf">presentations</a> of the work each team has been doing for the project, as well as a full afternoon dedicated to planning collaboration, including possible students exchange and professor visits.
