<a href="/people">Prof. Vincent Lepetit</a> from Ecole des Ponts ParisTech is starting a visit to Kyoto University for 1 month within the framework of the TOSAI project. This visit starts a new collaboration with Kyoto Uniersity's <a href="http://vision.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/">Computer Vision Lab</a> on 3D scene understanding and will hopefully lead to students exchange in the near future.
